# Where in the World? (countries-world)
## About The Project
### Goal:
This app uses the REST Countries V2/V3 API to pull country data and display it inside the home page.
With that being said, while using this app the user can:
* Check all the countries available.
* Search a specific country through the input field.
* Filter countries by region.
* Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.


### Built With:
This app was built using the [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) library. You can check the list of technologies used below:
* [Functional Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html?)
* [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#api)


### Inspiration:
The idea for this app was taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
Although the idea came from the aforementioned website, all the code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs and the decision for the use of this stack to build it) was entirely mine.

### Challenges and future updates:
During the development of this website the main challenges were deploying the website and making it responsive for all devices.
Future improvements:
* Development of tests with RTL.
* Adding a better looking design for the detailed page.
* Adding a favorite section, where the users can save their favorite countries.
* Adding a game section, where a random flag is given and the user tries to guess the country name.
